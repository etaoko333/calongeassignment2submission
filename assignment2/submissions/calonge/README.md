## Kubernetes, Docker, Containerisation and Virtualisation

1. Advantages of Container
Portability
Effective resource usage
Easier to maintain.
High scalable 
Disadvantages
Lacking security measures
Runs only on OS
advantages
Virtual Machine
Hard security boundaries
Can emulate multiple OS
More resources
Disadvantages
In effective resources usage
Harder to maintain on OS
Not portable
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and setting
how to run docker: 1.   Step 1: Get the sample application. If you have git, you can clone the repository for the sample application. ...
2.  Step 2: Explore the Dockerfile. ...
3.  Step 3: Build your first image. ...
4.  Step 4: Run your container. ...
5.  Step 5: Verify that your container is running.

## CICD, Infrastructure as as Code (IaC), Terraform, Packer and Ansible

1. Idempotence is any function that can be executed several times without changing the result beyond its first iteration
Terraform excels as a cloud infrastructure provisioning and deprovisioning tool with an IaC approach. It's a specific tool with a specific purpose. Ansible offers an all-purpose, cross-domain automation solution. Both have active open-source communities and well-supported downstream commercial products
mutable infrastructures originally developed when the use of physical servers dictated what was possible in their management and continued to develop as technology improved over time. 
immutable infrastructures were designed from the start to rely on virtualization-based technologies for fast provisioning of architecture components, like cloud computing's virtual servers. The speed and low cost of creating new virtual servers make the immutable server infrastructure, or immutable infrastructure paradigm, practical.
imperative tool, you define the steps to execute in order to reach the desired solution. With a declarative tool, you define the desired state of the final solution, and the automation platform determines how to achieve that state
## System Architecture and Application Design, Cloud Computing (AWS)
HashiCorp Terraform helps organizations improve productivity, reduce risk, and increase business velocity as they integrate cloud into their IT environments.
GitHub Actions make it easy to automate all your software workflows now with the help of CI/CD. Build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub
Runners allows you to run builds in Pipelines on your own infrastructure, and you won't be charged for the build minutes used by your self-hosted runners. The following guides help you configure your operating system with Pipelines to use runners within your repositories
1.  On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2.  Under your repository name, click Actions.
3.  In the left sidebar, click the name of the workflow you want to run.
4.  Above the list of workflow runs, select Run workflow.
5.  Select the Branch dropdown menu and click a branch to run the workflow on
Automate, customize, and execute your software development workflows right in your repository with GitHub Actions. You can discover, create, and share actions to perform any job you'd like, including CI/CD, and combine actions in a completely customized workflow
